Dear translators!

We tried to salvage your locales from when we had to remove them [10 months ago](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/tree/10b19ea79b1fb728d97af89e74edca9d03208a75/locales). Unfortunately, a lot has changed since them, which made them outdated. Here are the issues we found, comparing them to en_US (which is the leading locale).

Any help to restore these locales is greatly appreciated <3
